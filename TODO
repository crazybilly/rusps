TODO
==================

  - think through workflow
  - way to concat addresses using either
    - tidyselect
    - named list (probably this)
  - way to separate mashed together address
  - function to compare addresses (like a join)
  - rename the package
    - how hard is this (try a git branch)
    - move the github repo?
  - rewrite README.rmd
